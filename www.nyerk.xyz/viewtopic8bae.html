				<div class="content">I guess best way is selling supplements.<br>
But as that is quite limitated i dont think there is a way to make tonns of kinah atm.<br>
Maybe a script for getting snowflakes and put it in acc store could earn u some decent money without much effort.<br>
Another way would need some quite good dps scripts and run 6 clients at the same time to let 6 bots rush some instances and then sell the loot.<br>
But that would require a lot of work to create the main script and the dps profiles for the classes as most classes do significantly less dmg if played by a bot.<br>
Also im not sure how far dodgeing could be implemented as i dont know if we can call a function to recognize aoe attacks.</div>

				<div class="content">It does have three movement types:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">MoveTo </strong>which does the spastic mini teleports -&gt; dead giveaway you bot, only used inside instances<br>
<strong class="text-strong">MoveSmooth </strong>which moves just like you would between points<br>
<strong class="text-strong">FlySmooth </strong>a recent addition that was added after I told Paraly that the flight script was bad because it was using mini teleports, this flies like you would fly yourself.<br>
<br>
Another thing it does is allows you to make it put the pin automatically which needs the client to be on foreground momentarily while it recognizes the letters.<br>
<br>
But there is nothing to put your username and password, because you need to be already logged in with a char to start Vanilla already. The only thing you would need pin for is if one or more of your chars to be logged in an account are in FT server or go to Panesterra.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
If AS has the ability to do simple clicks with the mouse in specific coordinates, it should be possible to make change chars. But I am not sure how AS behaves when the client it is attached goes to character screen. Does it still work or does it get stopped?</div>
