				<div class="content">I would hate to see a nice project like this die, so there are two ideas:<br>
<br>
1. Make it on payment.<br>
<br>
2. Put the source code available here on this hidden forum and make a guide so users can fiind the memory offset themself and put them on the AionInterface.dll alone<br>
<br>
You chose, it would be bad to let this project die</div>

When i started to use A.S it was paid long time ago, i like A.S its a really nice and simple scrit, i really dont use it for many things tbh.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Blastradius stop support A.S even this being paid, you came and support it for us for free, it was really nice from you. THANK YOU VERY MUCH !<br>
<br>
And i would be glad to pay for you support man !<br>
<br>
MAKE IT PAID ! you should had make it paid since you start to support A.S after Blastradius stoped it.  i`m sure ppl will pay for you support to A.S man. make it paid on Paypal like before.</div>

* Added support for latest EU client<br>
* Fixed Skillcooldown Detection/Autochain<br>
<br>
I have decided that i will no longer update Aionscript as i no longer play Aion.<br>
Sry for you guys but the time to update AionScript without getting something in return is just too much.<br>
<br>
The forums will stay online at least a few months from now on, but no promise.<br>
<br>
Quick Tip for NA Players.<br>
Backup your bin32 folder.<br>
Start Aion, copy backupped bin32 folder into Aion Folder.<br>
Start RebootAion32.exe<br>
Now you have started an older version of Aion which supports current Aionscript.
</div></blockquote>

how do u use old backupped bin32 without going through the launcher auto repair mode?<br>
<br>
even if you copy it into aion folder, it will just be overwritten back immediately. can someone help?</div>

Maybe thats why nuclear decided not to update it anymore. It would be a huge task to work to bypass that nyerk.<br>
