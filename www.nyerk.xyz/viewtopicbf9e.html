It has been a hot topic in the forum for quite a long time. Doing these instances (or using any hack at all) is a risk the player knows is taking.<br>

<br>
If people is dumb enough to do this blatantly in front of everyone's face then there's nothing else to expect but a review in your account and a future ban. Just be smart and do it when nobody is around and do a "normal" amount of runs and not a nyerkton to reach lvl 75 in one day.</div>

Dunno... But seems like there is no checking script yet in this dungeon. I already did it a lot of times. Sure, i'm entering KB when no ppls around and i'm always in invisible status and in my friendlist no random ppls. But i'm always do it by myself w/o teleporting scripts and even placed 2 traps at start, when anuhart appears <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> This is, of course, not a panacea, but it's just for sure, cos i remember how they ban me for doing baruna instance w/o starting timer and not used a single door (i failed a bit and recalled after 1st kill with keys in my inventory)</div>

				<div class="content">Don't wanna create a new thread... Just one question :3<br>
My bot was grinding at spot and when i checked it... AS were crushed and bot kicked for being afk. After logging in i found my bot standing on rookie server at elyos starting point at lvl 1 (Akarios Plains).  Then i tried to use recall and it was binded at the same point <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
What did you think about this situation? Was it GM or just some lag after AS crush?<br>
PS bot is still runningm but on other spot and don't get banned <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>
