				<h3>Radar.dll</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
as I am playing in 4K I was wondering if it is possible to change the size of AionScript windows, i.e. the radar.<br>
After decompiling Radar.dll with "JetBrains dotPeek" I can see that the window size is set in the sub InitializeComponent():<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>private void InitializeComponent()
    {
[...]
      this.Settings.Size = new Size(180, 180);
[...]
</code></pre></div>

However, I have not managed to modify the specific settings, yet. If my understanding is correct I would need to export the C# code / project, modify the setting and recompile the code (i.e. with Visual Studio). Is this correct?<br>
<br>
Any help would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

				<div class="content">Hi again,<br>
<br>
just wanted to let you know that I made some progress:<br>
<br>
radar.dll:<br>
+ decompiled<br>
+ fixed false code<br>
+ resized the AionRadar bitmap to double size and added it as new ressource which is used as radar bitmap<br>
- to do: fix one code issue regarding monster entities on the radar<br>
<br>
entities.dll:<br>
+ decompiled<br>
+ fixed false code<br>
+ adjusted window size to double size<br>
+ resized column sizes and font size<br>
- to do: fix one code issue regarding panic mode (GM detection)<br>
<br>
I am happy to share the result once I have managed to fix the two code issues. These are only minor issues though...</div>

Hi mavel,<br>
<br>
thank you for your efforts.<br>
Personally i didn't touch the extensions yet as the main program needs still some fixes.<br>
If you have a working version you can upload it here or send it to me via pm.<br>
<br>
By the way, there is a newer entities version out there called entities2.dll .<br>
Will have to look for it to find it somewhere on my disk as i'm not using it currently.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi nucular,<br>
<br>
many thanks for your feedback.<br>
I have been looking for entities2.dll but was not able to find it, yet.<br>
<br>
However, I have finished the 4K-versions of radar.dll and entities.dll. If you are playing the game in 4K and don't have eagle eyes, you might want to give it a try.<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
Simply replace radar.dll and / or entities.dll in \AionScript\Extensions<br>
<br>
For the future I am planning to release an updated version of radar.dll and entities.dll that includes both, normal and 4K version, switchable via settings.xml.</div>

I.e. for radar.dll:<br>
<br>
Before:<br>
<br>
Game.add_OnFrame(new AionEventHandler((object) this, __methodptr(_RunFrame)));<br>
this._hInterface.SettingsGatherable.Checked = bool.Parse(hSetting["Object"]);<br>
<br>
Now:<br>
this._hInterface.SettingsGatherable.Checked = bool.Parse(hSetting["Gatherable"]);<br>
Game.OnEntities += new AionEventHandler(this._RunFrame);<br>
<br>
The "false" code was probably created during decompilation.</div>
