Had a few Issue's with it only using Hellish Fissure and Terror's Restraint when it gets to the boss room. he is at 19m so Terror's Restraint isn't hitting anything. After the boss dies it go straight for the Portal and skips the XP beads. I tried it on a couple guys, to make sure it wasn't a bug. <br>
<br>
It's still a "B" rank around 40 minutes left on the clock each time.</div>

That's the way it should be, Hellish Fissure attacks from 25m, and terror's restraint is there to protect you in case you pick some aggro.<br>

That's weird, it should kill exp beads first then loot the quest box and finally leave the instance using the teleport. I'll check it again in case I missed something while doing copy-paste in forum  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Edit:</strong> I did 6 runs using the NA script posted on this thread and I got 5 Rank A, and 1 Rank B. Experience beads were destroyed and quest box was looted afterwards. <br>
<br>
The only bug I can think of is about B ranks, but that's because NPC are really dumb sometimes and they take longer to clean the instance :/. I'll add some extra DPS on last boss to avoid this case.</div>
