It doesn't work with the " AionScript Release 15.03.2017 " version.<br>

sometimes it bugs and stops using fan of flames for a bit but it starts back up... not sure why, but all the Skills work for me on NA.</div>

Make sure you are not using potions as they share the cooldown id with these skills.<br>
Like i said AionScript doesn't support high daeva skills. It's just a workaround.<br>

Fissure of Oblivion is a special case as the new high daeva skill's behave different then "normal" skills.<br>
Cooldown's are managed differently and don't work correctly with the implementation.

<br>
The script it's working fine, if you cannot get it working, please read and learn more about Aionscript.<br>
<br>
Aionscript it's not a bot for people that don't want to learn things beyond "Install , Press Play"<br>
<br>
The name says it already.. Aion SCRIPT , you need to understand programming if you want to use it.<br>
<br>
There is a lot of code involved, and you need to know where to use and how to use it.<br>
<br>
I'm an Aionscript user for about 3 years, and what bothers me since it's original forum, is that people are too lazy to read basic instructions , or to simple read the Topic frrm it's first page and get all the information that was already shared.<br>
<br>
Thnx guys for sharing a Field of Fissure helper.</div>
