				<div class="content">All windows fromt his bot are always on top, I know there is a reason for them to be on top but when I am playing in solo isntances and in full window mode, those icons drop my fps by half or something.<br>
<br>
In Windows 7 click on AS and then on a folder, then back on AS and then abck on the folder, hid it. But I am on windows 10 here and this doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Any way to turn the always on top feature off?<br>
<br>
I did minimize the two windows but radar needs to be closed, you cannot keep it behind anything if it is open.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you.</div>
