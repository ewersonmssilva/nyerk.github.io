				<div class="content">AS does have the ability to do everything.<br>
<br>
1) Talk to NPCs and handle quests, abandon quests etc. You can see something like this happening to crafting.lua<br>
2) Moving to paths, now that we have another option in the path of a script (the rest, move, action etc) it would be more than possible.<br>
3) Kill mob, that is for sure a thing and checking the inventory for a specific item is possible to see if you got all the quest items, or even count the amount of mobs you killed or better yet, see if the quest is completed (there must be a marker for that too).<br>
<br>
I remember doing quest scripts on l2walker for Lineage II, but that was a different programming language and I also did plenty of scripts in zRanger for L2 again.<br>
<br>
I have also done myself a script in Macro Express 3 both for L@ leveling and for Aion alchemy work orders before I realized there was a script in AS already, it is a simple "clicker" program with abilities move the mouse etc, it needed a lot of caution to make something work but it was working<br>
<br>
The above mentioned programs were much more simple, they couldn't handle as many as AS can, with the exception to zRanger (that was supposedly able to do aion too but never worked) that was capable of doing more than L2Walker but not as much as AS.<br>
<br>
Thus it is possible to do practically EVERYTHING on AS, given the fact all commands work properly, because some times when the client is updated some commands need to be fixed, and when a few commands are not in use in the typical scripts nobody takes notice they need a fix.<br>
<br>
Now how to do this on AS... that is another thing, you need to know how to code in lua and know theoretically everything about how AS handles those things.<br>
<br>
Personally, I can do very few things, the pdf that shows the full command list is simply naming them, you can only see the existing scripts and see form there the most basic commands and know how to alter them. But to make a script on yourself, you need to be familiar with lua language.</div>

				<div class="content">Well I wish that too but I will burst the bubble. The script was not done while Blastradius was getting paid for it. I doubt anyone will make a huge script for questing, taking into consideration there are so many repeatable worthy quests.<br>
<br>
If I could get the handle of lua I would have already made plenty of these. I just find the documentation on the pdf almost useless. It only mentions the names of the commands and variables.</div>
