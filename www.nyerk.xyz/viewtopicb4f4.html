On the serverside your position is validated which does not allow you to pass through everything.<br>
Simple gameobjects like teleporter statues in main cities are client side only but for example doors/walls are serverside based.<br>
This is also the cause for teleporting. You will get backported because the serverside says no, thats new position from the old position is not possible. The same applies to run speed, if you increase it too high you will get backported.</div>

Exactly.<br>
If i try to use teleport to pass a door i got backported, same thing if i try to use no gravity and fly in the sky ( higth quota respect to ground), i got teleport to the group.</div>

So noclip won't help you either. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";-)" title="Wink"></div>

				<div class="content">But there are a couple of things you can pass through that normally you wouldn't like edges on walls etc.<br>
<br>
Vanilla Tool can go through a lot of stuff and there is no clipping back. Like I run the fissure automatic script and he literally goes straight down tot he ground in the beginning. He probably found all those weak spots of the graphics and takes advantage of them.<br>
<br>
Another thing we could take advantage is the gliding feature so when we use a move-to command it won't get teleported, of course you need to take into consideration the speed of the gliding (I just saw that in Vanilla as well).<br>
<br>
Because if you want to move your char while in mid air without gravity, at some point he will get teleported back with AS, but somehow the Vanilla creator found a way to do it with success.</div>

<br>
It is just that you need a lot of practice to learn where they are unless there is a way to see the invisible walls and weak spots via some addon that will re-draw the graphics with everything in it. I mean you need to see them and take the exact x,y,z locations to turn it into a code that can be run over and over again.</div>

U can use this tool to "debug" graphics <a href="https://gpuopen.com/archive/gpu-perfstudio/" class="postlink">https://gpuopen.com/archive/gpu-perfstudio/</a></div>
