				<div class="content">The scripting is old, you need to change the names i they are old, my chanter heals himself and also heals group members if he is in a group. I had to alter the script dramatically to do it.<br>
<br>
Also AS uses a weird way to script, I am a computer programmer, I have scripted in many programs and I find AS very hard to work with.</div>
