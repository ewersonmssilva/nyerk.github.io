				<div class="content">nucular not playing aion anymore, thats new info for us. dammit we're screwed &gt;.&lt;<br>
<br>
anyway, attack speed doesnt work on AS for now. but do u think attack speed works on other aion hacks like paravilla or aion hack tools?<br>
and if it works over there, is it possible for us to use AS and those tools at same time, I wonder?<br>
<br>
**also since AS is making the game character runs in slow motion atm, is it possible for us to disable the attack speed effect temporarily, maybe by removing some files in the folder or something... because some of the other functions are still working nicely, like grinder framework, ninja auto launch skills and so on. its just the slow motion that is affecting everything atm</div>
