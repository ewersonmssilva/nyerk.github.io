				<div class="content">Hello guys, I would like to know if anyone else is having issues with bans in Aion NA recently, I got 6 accounts blocked so far and they were blocked by just loggin in and taking the event bags, not even botting or doing anything suspicious. As far as I know, multi accounting is not forbidden, so idk if it has something to do with using AS in a passive way, such as radar, entities, 50% atk s, and some mov speed.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br>
<br>
Edit: I got them back, apparently you can get automated IP blocks if you use BP, VPN or any programs of this kind.</div>

				<div class="content">I have botted normally, did my hacks in fissure and crucible spire as well. So far nothing.<br>
<br>
If you just logged in an got banned maybe they had some IP suspicions and blocked anyone who logged. Just send them tickets with each account and ask them why this happened. I have gotten banned int he past too and they unbanned me after I messaged them.</div>
