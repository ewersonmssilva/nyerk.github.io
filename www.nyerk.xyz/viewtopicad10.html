				<div class="content">I have posted info about a little project in the VIP section to rework and revamp the OfficialGrinderFramework - more detail can be requested if you're interested!<br>
So imagine it all as open recruitment - people who are interested PM me, I will send the details and what you need to start working on the project. In one or two weeks, we'll see who's contributed most, been most active etc and has a chance to be added to the group! We are not offering IMBA HAXOR programs there but good knowledge base, community support for a LUA script you are working on etc!<br>
<br>
I look forward to hearing from you al!!</div>

You've got the wrong idea, it will always be free. The VIP stuff if for people who pay in sharing their knowledge and help out around here.</div>
