				<h3>NA - Drop rate decreased confirmed</h3>

				<div class="content">Alright so I noticed after 5.6 launched in NA that the drop rate is so bad that past 66 lvl you won't be getting any mythic drops anymore, unless you grind like 10 hours to get 1 drop or something.<br>
<br>
I usually enter luna daily, and then 2x fissure, and I use a 100% amulet. So when I am done with all these three entries, I still have like 35~40 minutes of amulet XP bonus, so I am burning it in Upper Abyss in 72~73 lvl mobs. Within the 35~40 minutes I would play, sometimes I would have 4 mythic drops.<br>
<br>
Before 5.6 (at some point) I left my char afk for like 3 hours with the sidekick akumu for auto-scrolls and I had almost 3 rows of my inventory (3x9 = 18 slots) full of frostforged mythic items (head, body or even weapons)<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Now I only get junk and some +1/2/3 archdaeva manastones and cheap basic materials.<br>
<br>
This is what I got in about 35 minutes of XP (the timer says 40 minutes but this is because I hit the reset on timer about 5 minutes before I started the actual grinding). Anyway it is  157 mobs killed, so time doesn't matter. I usually kill about 300~330 mobs per hour at that spot.<br>
<br>

<br>
Then I asked on LFG if they screwed drop rates and everyone confirmed that NCSoft did this to harm the bots.<br>
<br>
In reality they harm real players more, my char can still survive with the rest of the drops if I bot plenty of hours.</div>

				<div class="content">In my experience it is and was far more effective to not let the bot level to 66 and just grind bt or dp for cashloot and sell it to an npc.<br>
Dont know about NA though playing on EU.</div>

				<div class="content">Well it was much much better to grind on 66+ mobs before 5.6, I could get myself like 4~5 mythic 73 lvl items in 1 hour with my sorcerer that would sell for about 10~20m each and if it was a weapon they could get as much as 50~80m.<br>
<br>
Of course this is Upper Abyss so I wouldn't get other drops that drop in Norsvold but you get the point.<br>
<br>
Now it only worths staying either 65 to grind in low areas or better yet stay lvl 60 so you can be on fast track server and exploit the same spot but many different characters, or be able to go to areas that are pvp in normal server, for example Ensar, there are mobs up to 65 lvl there.<br>
<br>
But can you set a bot to XP afk in BT? And do you still get descend drops from that at (lets say) 60 lvl?<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I am getting my new pc next week, I will be able to load like 10 clients if I want to so I'll start raising new chars in order to have them bot for me afk.</div>

				<div class="content">In BT u get like 8-12kk just from selling to NPC, also u get some ap so u are not as suspicious in open world^^<br>
But it will take some manuel stuff, you need to go through wall or kill the 1. boss and the horse.<br>
Also magic classes are much more effective and good gear on your dd is also important.<br>
If you have a cleric healing your dd it should work.<br>
In 66+ area there are myth drops but on my experience they didnt sell well, 3-5kk each if some one buys it at all.</div>

Well I am willing to make like 10 chars bot afk or something so making manual BT is not my cap of coffee.<br>
<br>
I play in NA servers and those 72~73 mythic drops were being sold more than 10m each unless it was a helmet that went as low as 3m each.<br>
<br>
Enshar is here:<br>
