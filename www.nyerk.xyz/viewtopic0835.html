				<h3>Securing your Client from Telemetry (ncdiagS32.exe)</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Feb 02, 2017 2:55 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Good morning all,<br>
<br>
During my messind around and editing AION files, I came to notice a constant creation of ZIP files. Having done some research I found out the following:
<ul>
<li>1. ncdiagS64.exe &amp; ncdiagS32.exe is a diagnostics tool used to collect your PCs info. It is used to create a common &amp; compatable profile for clients tweaking sake. It also sends any Injected DLLs and a log of accessed offsets. <br>
2. It sends the info to NCSoft in Korea (dev IP) and to a Gameforge IP (can't pinpoint the exact server pool).<br>
3. We do not want this - chances are your tweaking your system.cfg and editing PAK files anyway, so I doubt your gonna need a diagnostics log to send for support.</li>
</ul>

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size: 120%; line-height: normal">PLEASE DO NOT apply these rules to <span style="text-decoration: underline">AwesomiumProcess.exe</span> - this is the HTML backend of the Aion interface!</span></strong><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">How to prevent this:</span><br>
<br>
In order to prevent anything from being sent to anywhere through telematry services, we are going to block the two EXEs in the Windows firewall:<br>
<br>
1. Navigate to the Control Panel and select Windows Firewall to bring up the basic Firewall interface<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/vICliht.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
2. Click on “Advanced settings” to access the advanced Firewall interface (Left hand side menu)<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/zqiPX6q.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
(<span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">I’d encourage you follow along closely, leaving anything outside the scope of the tutorial and your experience level alone; mucking up your firewall rules is a surefire way to a big headache</span>)<br>
<br>
3. In the far left navigation pane, select “Outbound Rules”. This will pull up all the existing outbound firewall rules.<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/SUCHv4H.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
4. In the far right navigation pane select “New Rule…” <br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/JtlP7eh.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
5. By default the rule type selection should be “Program”, but confirm that it is before clicking “Next”.<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/yGzeaZqd41d.png?" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
6. Here you will insert the path to the program you wish to block.<br>
eg.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\games\aioneu\bin32\ncdiagS32.exe</code></pre></div>
and repeat for the following program paths:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>bin32\ncdiagS32.exe
bin32\ncdiagS64.exe
bin64\ncdiagS32.exe
bin64\ncdiagS64.exe
</code></pre></div>

For easiness sake, just repeat the process from step <strong class="text-strong">4.</strong><br>
<br>
7. Once you’ve selected your application and confirmed the path, click “Next” &amp; on the next screen confirm that “Block the connection” is selected. Click “Next”.<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/WN0zKQ2.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
8. On the next page you’ll be asked to select when the rule applies (by default all three items are checked). It’s important to <strong class="text-strong">CHECK ALL OF THEM!</strong><br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/0KZ4IKq.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
9. Name the rule! This can be anything (I usually name it after the EXE), just make sure you its something you recognise and remember!<br>
<img src="../i.imgur.com/b9W0ZMf.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
10. When you’ve filled the appropriate information in, click “<strong class="text-strong">Finish</strong>”.</div>

ah yeah, everytime that my client was crashing due to any error the ncdiag.exe file was popping out into process list so I was instantly killing it right after  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>
