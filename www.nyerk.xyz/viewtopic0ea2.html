				<div class="content">Is there any reason why that guy "Para's Vanilla tool" or whatever his name is, can go through walls and be able to move just by the move command, but AionScript fails to do so?<br>
<br>
Most of the times you need to find a graphic weak point to be able to get into areas you shouldn't, like stair or edges of rocks etc. If you simply try to move up/down/front and there is an obstacle, you simply get ported back.<br>
<br>
Also if you are in no gravity and you move your char front/right/left you also get this effect. If you are in no gravity and you stand in mid air, try to go upwards with the shortcut... you will go upwards for a couple of times and then you will ported back to the original spot you were standing in air.<br>
<br>
So is AS using some different technique or is it a feature of it? Because that guy has made 100% automated scripts that your char goes around by teleporting to points and he never get ported back.<br>
<br>
Is there something we can do about it?</div>

				<div class="content">Well i used AionScript to move through instances and walls and it works.<br>
But you can also use Paraly's software if you like.<br>
And basically you will get backported if you move too fast, look inside cheating lua and change for example the "Super Gliding Distance".<br>
Paralys move works because he makes always small steps, that's it.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the input on this one. I did figure it wanted smaller steps so it won't get ported back. But even with accurate moving with tiny steps I still get ported, especially if I go vertically upwards.<br>
<br>
I didn't use vanilla tool, it needs to be paid. I just saw the videos.</div>

				<div class="content">it's a little bit tricky but when you get used to it you can walk anywhere just with gravity and accurated on <br>
<br>
if you walk too far you have to make sure to save spots so dont teleported back at the start</div>
