				<div class="content">Alright I run the daily and I got an s-rank, it is amazingly good.<br>
<br>
My suggestions:<br>
<br>
1) The char didn't kill all cores in the end because he was still high in the air and thus his aoe hits didn't get all cores. In the end he should simply drop to ground and go hit the cores, either by making a few aoe hits which is sure it will kill them all, or even better keep targeting the cores and aoe as long as he can still target at least one. But since it stays there, we can kill them by hand later. Still something that could be fixed<br>
<br>
2) When the final boss comes, the 5th skill which does a tone of damage could be done, that skill has a casting animation BUT is not canceled if you teleport or you move normally like a char. It is not the most important thing but it won't hurt simply doing it when it is ready.<br>
<br>
3) My char had 1 aether unused because it was an odd number, when the final boss arrives and you still have unused canon slot and 1 aether, then the char should use his last aether to an empty canon slot and select the 1st option for the smaller canon. More dps this way.<br>
<br>
My pc was at about 35% CPU so I can run 3 clients at the same time with my sandboxie.<br>
<br>
Still a better love story than twilight by far <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<div class="content">A few things that could be "fixed"<br>
<br>
When he enters the instance, the first canon is not used, it opens the menu but doesn't use the first 3 aether, he then uses them when the next wave of mobs are about to come and also usually after he looted the first MAD-74C mob. He then uses 2 canons, my char used the 2nd,3rd and 4th canons correctly and he still had 3 aether but the first canon was never used.<br>
<br>
I suggest the very first canon before anything appears, use an aoe cannon just to be sure. This i s marginally losing S-rank sometimes because the whole 1st wave is done without any canons opened.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Anyway as stated the three canons do this:<br>
<br>
1) Single target, low dmg, but it is hitting kinda fast, like more times per second than the other two. When I say attack speed, I mean both the hitting dmg time and the interval between hits.<br>
2) Area canon, it does medium damage but it is aoe, it is the slowest in attack speed and at times I think it simply sits there not hitting at all for a good amount of time even if there are mobs there to hit. It charges the shot and then takes a lot of time before ti shoots again.<br>
3) Single target high damage, slower hitting speed than 1st option but more hits per time unit than 2nd option canon. It has some charging too, like a continuous beam for dmg and the interval between attacks the in between the other two.<br>
<br>
What I have read, which I cannot confirm, is that if you get 2 canons of the 1st option (thus 2x 1 aether each) you end up getting more dps than getting one single cannon of the 3rd option.<br>
<br>
So if you have two empty slots of canon and 2 aether, you better use both canon slots with 1 aether each (1st canon) than to use one slot only with 2 aether on it (3rd canon option).<br>
<br>
I hope I didn't confuse you <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
1st + 1st = 2 aether<br>
3rd = 2 aether<br>
BUT 1st + 1st &gt; 3rd in dmg</div>
