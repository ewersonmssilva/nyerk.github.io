				<div class="content">So in 6.0 everything will be soul bound, except stigma they said or some skins. Kinah is soul bound (but since you can broker skins you can always probably trade kinah like that, I guess), you cannot set a private store, you cannot /trade anyone anymore etc.<br>
<br>
I think they try so hard to fight botters and kinah sellers to the point they will kill the game. I am thinking of selling my 30 billion kinah to a site and forget about Aion after 6.0</div>

				<div class="content">I belive in free to play mmorpg trade never die. Many people use real money to  buy in game item, if ncsoft block this mechanics aion will die in my opinion.<br>
I'm pretty sure we can still farm somethink to trade in 6.0 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>

				<div class="content">If we can still sell something then this is stupid, I will still be able to trade money from my bots to my main by putting something on broker so my alts will buy it.<br>
<br>
The kinah sellers will also tell people that buy kinah to put something in broker for the amount of kinah they bought, so the kinah seller can go and purchase it so the money will transfer.<br>
<br>
All these things only make legit real players suffer more because most items will be soul bound now. And you know when real legit players suffer, the game dies.</div>
