				<div class="content">Hello, I realized that when there is ANY player near me (within the 90 radius visibility range that the game and AS have) AS goes in safe mode whatever I have chosen.<br>
<br>
That means my AS will keep auto-grinding BUT attack speed cheats, or glide hacks or gravity hacks simply do not work.<br>
<br>
I have tested it all, deleted the whole program, re-downloaded it, tried again etc. But nothing worked. And also whenever I log back in the method is set to "safe" but even if I put it in normal as I said it doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Does it work for everyone else except me?<br>

				<div class="content">Normal/ Safe is not a safety option. Is for access to mouse usage when bot attacking. Safety options are just Safety and Trust Force.</div>

				<div class="content">Ah yes, you are right, it is for mouse usage, the "safety" thing in the top options is to turn this on or off.<br>
<br>
And trust force is used with safety on, it only applies when other players are not there, because trust force excludes group and alliance members.<br>
<br>
thanks, my bad</div>
