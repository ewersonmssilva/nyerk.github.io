if you have this selected and there are other players around you, the hacks won't work for safety reasons. If you use a script for botting it will still work but the hacks won't.</div>

Thats exact what safety does.<br>
As son as a player is within 101m it deaktivates attackspeed, runspeed, supergliding... <br>
If you aktivate Trust Force it wont deaktivate if only group members are around.<br>
Though autochain should work.</div>

				<div class="content">Safety does that, it doesn't stop AS from running a script (so if you are afk grinding it will continue gringing), but it does stop all hacks from that user interface up there, and it does that whenever ANYONE except your char is in the spot.<br>
<br>
Trust force, as the guy above mentioned, does exactly the same but excludes group members, so if only your group is around hacks will work, if other people come, hacks will be disabled. I am not sure about alliance members though to be honest.<br>
<br>
So did you try unchecking it and let us know if it worked.</div>

<br>
I do not know what could be wrong on your side. What server are you playing?</div>
