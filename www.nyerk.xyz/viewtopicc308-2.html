				<div class="content">I cant tell if AS can perform functions like the ones you described, but I'm sure you can make a simple script with the program WinAutomation for this case, since you need to log out, and then log in, placing the PIN could be a problem, because it changes the number sequence randomly. Good luck.</div>

				<div class="content">i dunno about that funcionality, but i think it is not possible today.<br>
<br>
What i think you could do is enable DP morphing while grinding with a character instead of using DP skills, that could be a solution.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey I did what you are saying here but I did it with macro express 3.5<br>
<br>
It is an amazingly awesome macro program that have so many abilities and I did what you mentioned. It is not easy now (or probably impossible) because of the pin, even if the characters are in the same account the pin at some point might re-appear.<br>
<br>
The macro express has the ability to see a specific pixel in a specific location and see its colour thus it would be possible for me to make a function to understand what number each box has.<br>
<br>
BUT I do not care for this anymore, I have elyos characters that I made on my own (I am an asmodian) and killing him once gives me 1050 DP... killing him 4 times and my DP is full, morph it out and then repeat. You can literally morph as much as you want this way.<br>
<br>
If you do not have a high level elyos for your main maybe try this: get a char to lvl 25, get an enemy char to 25 as well and take them both to abyss... see if killing the enemy gives you 1050 DP just like it does when you are high level (I think it does). this way you can teach the morphing recipe you want to the low lvl and simply do it with him.</div>
