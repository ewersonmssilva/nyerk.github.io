There are many games that use this Anti-cheat but there are still many hack programs that are still usable with them.
</div></blockquote>

True, there are ways to bypass this anti-cheat system. On the other hand it has other functions that are pretty problematic, isnt the hacking itself, but the possibility to not use VPN, multiclient, many accounts on the same IP, autoclick, etc. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Features:</strong>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Detect and reject VPN access (Game management company is able to handle it)
Detect of DirectX modulation and illegal call

Provide clear information

XIGNCODE3 Log Monitor:
Provide real-time detection status
Provide game statistics data as Daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly
Accessed counts
Executed counts
Server accessed counts
Multy executed counts
Hacking tool detection counts
Unknown hardware devise frequency of use
Nationally executed/access frequency of use
Game play frequency of use
Operate system frequency use
National VPN detour frequency use
List of nationality hacking tool detection/user
Provide daily/weekly/monthly user statistic data
Rank of hacking tool used IP
Rank of hacking tool used system
Rank of hacking tool used account
Provide daily/weekly data
Accessed account/system mapping information
Hacking tool detection log information
</code></pre></div>

Anyway they might know all this, wether they use all these features to take actions against their users (with a decreasing population) or not is up to them. They could have done something against hackers without using XIGNCODE3 and they didnt.<br>
<br>
At the end the most affected are the common players (casuals mostly), because, lets be honest, hacking is the least problem if we take in account all their content update in 5.8 which created a ridiculously huge gap between casuals and P2W with top gear in game.<br>
<br>
Hopefully there will be a way to get around this anti-cheat soon.</div>
