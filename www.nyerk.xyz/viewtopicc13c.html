				<div class="content">OK it seemed to create a problem for once but now it actually works. I closed it an opened it many times and it worked in the beginning, it keeps deleting the key bindings at some point though.<br>
<br>
<br>
(the first time I opened, this is what I saw, but then I closed it and re opened it and it worked like a charm, then closed it againa nd re-opened it and the key bindings were once again gone)<br>

				<div class="content">...ok let me do a double post. I really do not mind this happening anymore, I know I am putting the settings there over and over again, even if I make the settings.xml file read only it still does it.<br>
<br>
I just made the topic so as to ask if others have this issue as well. Thank you for your time of course.</div>
