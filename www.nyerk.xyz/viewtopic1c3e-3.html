				<div class="content">so i tried installing aion on my windows 10 laptop and i found out that i cant use AS on it. i dunno what the problem is. its either rebootaion32 doesnt work on windows 10 to make it runs on 32 bit. or AS just doesnt work on windows 10 in general. in any case, it says "please start game client first before AS"<br>
<br>
the same AS works fine on my win 7 desktop tho. it just doesnt work for win 10. waht could be the problem?</div>

				<div class="content">Is it NA servers or EU?<br>
<br>
In NA, you simply delete the aion.bin file in the 64 bit folder, so when you start the launcher and hit "play" the game simply loads the 32 bit client since it can't find the 64 bit one (because we deleted/renamed it)<br>
<br>
If this is EU then I cannot help you, I play in NA and I have never used the rebootaion32 file.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
But since you made it work on your windows 7 that means there must be a problem with the windows. So the admins could look it up. Are there any people playing in windows 10 here?</div>
