What specs will the pc need?<br>
16 or 32 gb ram?<br>

				<div class="content">I currently have a cheap one but I am upgrading next week with a new pc:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CPU: icore3 3.3GHz (2 core 4 nodes)<br>
RAM: 16GB RAM at 1600 MHz<br>
SSD: SSD Toshiba hard disc (it does make a difference trust me)<br>
GPU: and a cheap NVidia GeForce 210 (1GB RAM)</strong><br>
<br>
...and I can run 4 clients only, that is defo limited a lot by my processor and my GPU. Also critical errors are a thing especially when i try to trade items.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
But I am upgrading next week with this:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CPU: iCore 5 7600k 3,8GHz (4-core/node)<br>
Motherboard: Motherboard supports up to 64GB 2133MHz RAM but I'll put 16GB for start since it cost me a lot already, I plan to put more RAM as it goes, this motherboard takes 4x DDR4 slots, so once every now and then I'll be putting +1RAM 16GB to make it a total of 64 GB<br>
GPU: Radeon RX480 8GB (beast, that alone costs about 300~350$)<br>
...and I'll put my SSD there too.</strong><br>
<br>
That pc is a beast next to what I currently have, (it also cost me plenty of money and I won't even buy SSD or Screen since I already have it)<br>
<br>
I hope to be able to run at least 10 clients for start, I am not sure if I put 64GB RAM if it will be able to run more, but I'll give it a try.<br>
Time to get real with AS and botting <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

				<div class="content">I thought about a Ryzen (cause 8 Cores and should perform good for vm) with 32 gb ram an some cheap ass graphic card because vm doesnt take graphicards anyway.<br>
<br>
Also i got a lot of old 80-160gb hdd's so each vm  ~a 2 clients can have its own HDD for Performance reasons.<br>
AS will be Synced through google drive i guess so every vm has the newest improvements to it.<br>
<br>
Ryzen + Ram + Motherboard are like 600â‚¬.<br>
<br>
Propably ill run some kind of linux as host system and just connect via vnc so no screen or keyboard needet.<br>
I got enough pc cases over here so no problem at all.<br>
<br>
Though im not sure yet wich vpn service to get as gf bans/blocks some.</div>

				<div class="content">...well you sir are taking botting to the next level.<br>
<br>
I am not familiar with most of the things you said here, Virtual machine doesn't take graphic card? How can you even run the game then, doesn't it still need to be rendered via graphic card?<br>
<br>
And about that multiple copies of the client, it works better? I thought about it myself but I didn't know how much it would benefit it. I'll give it a try if it is like this.<br>
<br>
Noob question: does Linux run games now? I had to endure Linux/Unix in university, every student hated those lessons and we all gave a promise to never deal with Unix/linux again in our lives. I also knew back then that Linux had problems with gaming in general.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I remember when I was playing LineageII that there was also an out of game bot that allowed you to load like 50 chars if you wanted since it used no graphics and minimal RAM. It would be great if we could have a bot for Aion that we would be able to use it without an Aion client <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>
