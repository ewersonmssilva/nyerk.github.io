				<div class="content">Right, this only happens RANDOMLY AFTER 2-3 hours after using AS, I did some research for the error code:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Faulting application name: aion.bin, version: 5317.1019.519.11829, time stamp: 0x591e9599

It took me AGES to even understand it was AS at all, I found this: <br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/c9f2357f-46c4-4da9-9346-66b1d406aa00/faulting-module-path-cwindowssystem32msvcr120dll?forum=w7itproappcompat</code></pre></div>

Maybe it's relevant or I smoked too much? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>

My AionScript/Aion runs 16 Hours repeatedly without any crashes.<br>
Maybe you are using something in your lua script which is responsible for the crashing.</div>

				<div class="content">My client also crashes after some time with AS. It doesn't crash without AS, at least I never seen it.<br>
<br>
It usually crashes if I change map while using AS for too long (like 2 hours of usage, then use return skill, my client crashes). Sometimes I close AS before I change map for this purpose, I am not sure it works but I rarely ever get crashes like this.<br>
<br>
AS seems to have issues with the client ever since the beginning. And aethertapping is problematic some times. It is weird that previous and older games had more successful bots (like Lineage II with l2walker) and with Aion we kinda have to work with beta-type of bots that run into all sorts of problems and their functionality is kinda limited, like die and be able to go back to where you were to being again.<br>
<br>
But I am glad AS exists, even with all the problems it is the only bot Aion has at the moment. So thumbs up for AS.</div>

Aha, thanks for the tip! I'll take a look. Sorry I was VERY high when I posted this <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>
