				<div class="content">well since botting is nearly dead, it may be a good idea to have a hell pass script to afk farming there with the alt army. You need rank A or S so you cant 100% afk there. I think with only killing the big minions that destroy the gate and using orbs to put cannons should work.</div>

				<div class="content">I assume you talk about the Luna dailies (in NA it is called like this)<br>
<br>
The daily is called <strong class="text-strong">Contaminated Underpath</strong><br>
The weekly is called <strong class="text-strong">Secret Munitions Factory</strong><br>
<br>
I also thought about this, but the problem is the MAD-74C mob mostly not the others. If there was a way to find a specific mob by name and act upon it instantly, by the time MAD-74C was nearby we should select him and use the 5th skill no matter what else we were doing.<br>
<br>
Something could be done with the aether we would get, so they would automatically be counted and used. Like if Aether &gt;= 2 then select a blank canon slot and use the designated canon we would put int he script (I use the aoe now because they fixed it and it does a difference in the many mobs)<br>
<br>
This way we would be able to A-rank our daily and have a chance to get an omega, S-ranking is practically impossible even when you are playing it with all the hacks etc, because the first barrack will get destroyed unless you are super lucky and proc your paralyze godstone like 10 times to avoid it. OR be lucky and get the saam herb mobs and in this case you don't even need to do anything.<br>
<br>
I am a computer programmer, I can think of an algorithm, but I completely lack any knowledge of lua language, but this would be "simple" if I could get the process to find a mob by name and kill it before it kills us all. The rest would be spam skills 1 and 2 (the aoe).<br>
<br>
If the HP was getting low, he would move to the healing spot to fill up. We wouldn't make it too rough, after all we would chase a-rank only.</div>

				<div class="content">The next problem is: if we die as doesnt ress (atleast in eu).<br>
As the Heal thingy is not up 100% of time and some mobs are very hard (like the horse army) and i think there is no way to survive if we get aggro from them.<br>
If we dont get aggro first barricade wil fall anyway so max A rank if we have good dps.</div>

</div></blockquote>

Well to be honest I use something like this to go on the green area where you die (I float above so I do not die with it) and hit the mobs there while they cannot hit me back so instead of them hitting the barricade they simply try to hit me, the key is to keep moving slightly so they keep moving with you otherwise they will reset.<br>
<br>
But, I am not sure the ranged ones can be hit by us, I mean their range is much bigger than our skills' range. With the 1st aoe (the small and frequent one defo not), with the second aoe the range is pretty big.<br>
<br>
I always manually do the instance and I can't even always s-rank it even with the no gravity thing. I keep a distance of 3 non-accurate glide from the ground and most melee mobs can't hit me.<br>
<br>
Now lets be honest, s-ranking it on a script would be impossible, it would be like asking to run a hard instance in script and finish it on time or something. This daily Luna instance is made to be based on pure luck or extreme effort from user. A-rank would be the ideal since you still have the chance to get an omega or a tempering solution. Just imagine having like 10 account with 7 (max for NA) characters in it lvl 10 and keep spamming luna daily with each char, eventually tradeable omega stones would be worthless.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Now if I had to do this with a script I am sure I wouldn't be able, there are so many things I do not know how to use in lua scripting. Most commands are listed in that pdf file, but they are just named, they are not explained how to be used or called.</div>
