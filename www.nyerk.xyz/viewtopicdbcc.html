				<div class="content">It seems we are falling into old habits slowly, I see a lot of questions and no input.<br>
<br>
I am hereby going to declare <span style="text-decoration: underline">ONE rule</span> we all stick to. Seeing as we made the effort to get this back on track, from now on, anyone who has a question (in regards to LUA Scripting) is to <span style="text-decoration: underline">post the source</span>. This applies to the <span style="text-decoration: underline">original script</span> you are asking about and a post of <span style="text-decoration: underline">the source once you have fixed it</span>. I am going to confirm this with Nuclear and be <strong class="text-strong">DAMN STRICT</strong> about it! phpBB has a wonderful warning system.<br>
<br>
Please note, I am NOT going to start banning people AT ALL. Maybe find a plugin that restricts culprit members from viewing source code themselves!<br>
<br>
P.S For people who have misunderstood, I am not angry at all! Actually happy to see things are becoming active. I just am enforcing the sharing of information!</div>
