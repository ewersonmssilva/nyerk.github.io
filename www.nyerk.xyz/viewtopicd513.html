				<div class="content">Awesome script man, really, the combat + healing routine and decision according barricade status are superb.<br>
<br>
I would recommend to place the character a little bit further, the current coordinates are missing monsters that have high range, such as the "You feel a cold sensation" wave, Transfectant Flyers, they deal tons of damage from distance and the first barricade was almost down when the NPC killed them. Only Crushing Darkness (2) skill has enough range for them , Soul Skewer (1) cant reach them.<br>
<br>
<img src="../puu.sh/y0mmz/mspaint_2017-10-17_11-39-13.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Respecting MAAD-S boss, It would be better to get his aggro a little bit earlier into the acid pool a few seconds after you get him targeted, otherwise he will go inmediately for first barricade and take it down in no time. If you can get his aggro early, chances on getting S are highly increased.<br>
<br>
In resume: after the "Darkness energy" message appears, you should move to the center of the green acid pool and wait for MAAD-S boss, 5 metters above his head is enough to not get hit by him, after that you need to attack him and return to the original coordinate in front of the first barricade, so the NPC kill him. Leeches are not that important, they dont do that much damage to the barricade.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<img src="../puu.sh/y0n59/vlc_2017-09-09_15-56-58.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<img src="../puu.sh/y0n5h/vlc_2017-09-09_15-57-17.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

<br>
Infected Flesh Lump is not being looted, the script ends with infinite attacks to break the experience beads, its not that important tho, but it would be nice to loot it automatically.<br>
<br>
I will be testing the script with several characters, all possible bugs and recommendations will be posted here.

I'm a bit scared. Moving in the Green Acid Pool is normally impossible, there is ban risk? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>

I did it plenty of times and I had no bans so far. Actually, just using No Gravity inside any instance can give you a risk of ban, only if you are really unlucky to be inspected by a GM in that moment. I wouldnt worry too much, anyway you are only going over the acid pool for a few seconds while you get aggro and then going back to frontal barricade.<br>
<br>
I did 6 runs already, and all of them were A because the character is not getting MAAD-S aggro and he destroys the frontal barricade  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
<br>
I also noticed that Cursed Brave Warrior (horses) reset everytime because character gets aggro and since its attacking and not moving then they reset and go back to the spawn zone and come back with full health. This is pretty important because these horses have almost the highest dps in that instance, and everytime they reset they have more time to DPS the frontal barricade. It would be nice to implement a small X axis movement when target "Cursed Brave Warrior" is true, just like the one you did at the end (Y axis)  to avoid MAAD-S reset.</div>

interesting, i'll try to implement some "mini movement" to avoid to lose aggro</div>

The new position is perfect for any kind of wave, I noticed you change it according the monster you are selecting which is really smart.<br>
<br>
MicroTeleport is also working as intended, I havent seen any more horse reset.<br>
<br>
I got a "No appropiate target" spam everytime it tries to set up a new cannon, it seems the problem is at line 463:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>PlayerInput:Console("/Select tower platform")</code></pre></div>

The name for turret artifact in NA is "Defense Turret Platform"<br>
<br>
there are few issues with the MAAD-S boss:<br>
<br>
1) Right now the height of the original coordinate is only 2m above MAAD-S, enough for him to attack you, there's no way to survive this way, even if you use the fountain because his damage is too high. I recommend to go up a little bit from the original coordinate, just for the last boss stage (5m-6m above the boss is perfect).<br>
<br>
2) Y axis movement for "EscapeAggro" should be limited to Frontal and Rear barricade areas, I saw he's going to the instance spawn location (where the gate is), in that place boss will jump on top of the stairs get higher and he will hit you. It's important to stay close to both barricades, so you maximize DPS using both NPC lines.<br>
<br>
3) The routine for Acid Pool is nice, I would suggest to add more coordinates in order to make the return to frontal barricade slower, that way you can attack the boss for a longer time and build up some solid aggro. I got the aggro stolen because NPC damage is way too high compared to the few hits you give him before returning to barricade.<br>
<br>
PD: I got this error right after using the Hp fountain at the last boss stage, the script stopped after that.<br>

This is actually impossible, if i try to go up a little bit character position is auto-reset by client. I will try to work on some kids of "trick" later.<br>

Now movement is limited to Stairs-Barricade (MAD-S waste time to go up/down stair but not in spawn zone) .<br>

Now should keep aggro more easily. Still to improve.<br>

I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that, actually there's a way to do it. You should start the script in front of the first gate and then move from there to the cannons area, that way you can have a higher original altitude and then go higher to 5 - 6m over the Boss without getting client reset.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, there's no need to jump on the stairs, but some extra altitude is never bad tho.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
<img src="../puu.sh/xvFhz/vlc_2017-09-09_15-46-23.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<img src="../puu.sh/xvFiX/vlc_2017-09-09_15-46-42.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
I'll test the current version and add my feedback as soon as possible.</div>
