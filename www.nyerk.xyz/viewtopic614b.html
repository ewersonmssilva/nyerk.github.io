				<div class="content">This is a very noob temporary fix to make bot working again after 5.3 patch. Previously, after using the latest updated AS (15 march 2017), I'am having problems with my bot won't stop moving even-though it's already arrived at the destination position. It seems AS was unable to cancel the move forward action.<br>
<br>
I tried to fix the following offsets:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>    &lt;Action&gt;1670&lt;/Action&gt;
    &lt;ActionStage&gt;1674&lt;/ActionStage&gt;
    &lt;ActionEntry&gt;167C&lt;/ActionEntry&gt;
    &lt;ActionReady&gt;1750&lt;/ActionReady&gt;
</code></pre></div>
I don't know how to find the offset for ActionCancel, I hope it's not fatal, but at least for now my assassin bot is working.<br>
<br>
Just replace the AionInterface.dll with this one until the official fixes is available.<br>
Hope this helps you guys.</div>

You fixed it correctly. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";-)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
ActionCancel is currently not used.<br>
It's part of another Skill Casting System which Lev aka AionScript on epvpers forum implemented, but it isn't used in my versions.</div>

Firstly I have to agree with nucular! That's EXACTLY the fix but I guess you mean noob cause you patched it into the file rather than compiled it?<br>
<br>
Efforts are MUCH appreciated. Have you seen the idiots that use AionScript? Don't put yourself down! ANY effort is appreciated!<br>
<br>
@nucular - That's actually really useful to know for some of scripts I didn't understand why they were not working!</div>
