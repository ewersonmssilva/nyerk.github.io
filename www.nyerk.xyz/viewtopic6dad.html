				<div class="content">Hello, today I was running multiple instances of Aion Script with different characters. I noticed AS is consuming about 8-10% of Cpu use even while its idle (not running any script), is this normal?. I even removed all the extensions except Cheating2.dll but the cpu is still the same. Any ideas of why is this happening and if there is a way to reduce consumption at minimum?. Thank you.<br>

I restarted my system many times but the cpu consumption is the same  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>

Oh  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad">, It would be really awesome to have an option to deactivate these functions (Say, click for light mode - low end PCs), anyway radar/entities is mostly used during PvP, but not inside PvE instances, so it takes a bunch of resources unnecessarily. <br>
<br>
To be honest, that's so far the only disadvantage I've ever found of AS, that Cpu consumption limits me to 4 simultaneous clients, 5 - 6 would bring system unstability, even tho my pc specs are really good. Other competitors consume low to no resources, that's why its only limited to how many Aion clients you can run in your PC instead.<br>
<br>
Its nice to know that's the reason. Thank you.</div>

Thanks cooco that's a good idea, I was deleting everything except Cheating2.dll, after deleting all the extensions it went to 1-2%, way better than the 8-10% I was having before  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"><br>
<br>
ohhh the possibilities...  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> <br>

				<div class="content">Wait a minute, if you delete all the extensions does it still work but you simply do not have shortcuts etc? Or do you still have the shortcuts but your simply cannot see the interface for that?<br>
<br>
I am running up to 8 clients with Vanilla and that is because I can set the fps as low as I want with a Vanilla script.<br>
<br>
With AS I could run 3~4 max, if I can make it run that low that will be a win win.</div>

				<div class="content">I am going to try it with luna script. Because with my rather good pc I could play 3 clients and 3 AS and my CPU woudl get marginal. If I opened mroe my chars would delay a lot and eventually die.<br>
<br>
I'll give it a check, if this allows me to have all 7 accounts playing and botting that is a win situation.</div>
