				<div class="content">almost all p servers i've seen so far were either instant lvl max or x5 xp rates.Being someone who tries out pretty much every server he comes across I've (unintentionally) developed a very optimized level route to level up as fast as possible. There are probably hundreds of lvl guides out there, but probably none for p servers. Here's how you can go from lvl1 to lvl14 in 5 minutes on the asmodian side (im sorry elyos players, I never once played the other race):
<ul><li>do the blue quest "on your feet!" (pretty obvious i guess, but dont accept the blue quest after that, its not worth it) -&gt; lvl2</li>

<li>kill 2 lvl2 mobs on your way to adelle -&gt; lvl3 -&gt;lvl4</li>
<li>cash in the 2 insta-complete quests in adelle</li>
<li>accept the blue quest "idle hands" from Kaindel in adelle</li>
<li>go to motgar to complete the quest (you can use no-clip + no-gravity to take a shortcut through the wall) -&gt;lvl6</li>
<li>tp to anturoon using the statue right next to motgar</li>
<li>you'll land right next to mijou, accept the blue quest "checking on a friend" from her</li>
<li>you can complete that quest on your way to the prison camp -&gt;still lvl6</li>
<li>grind the remaining 2 1/4 lvl on your way to munin -&gt; lvl9</li>
<li>ascension quest -&gt; lvl14</li>
<li>...</li></ul>

if you're playing without hacks, skip "idle hands" and airtransport to anturoon from adelle and grind to lvl6 there. Obviously you wont be able to do it in 2min30sec without hacks.<br>
<br>
I just found it interesting how much you could optimize the leveling process, i never expected to be able to get to ascension in less than 10 minutes even with hacks, and now I got it all the way down to 1/4 of that.<br>
<br>
I could map out a route like this up to lvl65, let me know if you're interested.</div>
