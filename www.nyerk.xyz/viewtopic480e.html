				<div class="content">Hi all.<br>
In previous versions (like few years ago), when you /search anything in chat it were marked like violet dot on AS radar. Is this feature blocked for free users or just cannot be added at all?</div>

K, got it. I just have thoughts aloud about vip and other stuff on this forum, nvm <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
Btw, i checked radar's menu and there is no additional search functions that could be marked on. For example, i did /search Nepeta or even chests in Tia Eye (3.x times &lt;3)... they were marked as purple dots, not green like all gatherable item. It really helps a lot when you need somethink special to gather or loot. It's a shame that i don't have any old screens atm... but i have an older version of AS, which were "development" by JannFoll. It still works on 5.1 and previous aion versions on private servers and it still marking search object with purple dot. Thanks in advance :3</div>

Sure, i tried to manipulate with aioninterface, entites and radar dlls, but AS always crushed, seems like new developer changed a lot of things in source code.</div>
