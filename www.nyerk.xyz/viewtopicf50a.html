Luna weekly S/A rank isnt that easy, monsters are grouped, as soon as you attack one you are pretty much dead, their attack patterns are not predictable. If you wait for NPC to kill all the monsters by their own you will have rank B or lower because it takes 20 minutes or more.<br>
<br>
The only way is to aggro monster groups, then go back to spawn zone, wait for NPC to take their aggro, and then help them with AoE skills to clear faster. You also need to DPS the big mechas with the highest dps skill, 1st and 2nd skill, and keep distance to not die by their explosions. Then kill the gunner to spawn the cannon and also be carefull to not get aggro from the side cannons which make huge damage from infinite range, kill the patrol that its right after gate, attack the 1st boss with 3rd skill and keep distance to not being pulled by his first skill, same with last boss.<br>
<br>
Honestly there are so many variables to take in account for luna weekly that S rank  makes it almost impossible, not to mention the benefits for S rank are (maybe one tempering per week), you can get the quest item even if you get D rank tho  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">.<br>
<br>
Anyway I'm down to provide ideas and testing any project cooco is willing to make.</div>

i think this can be done just manually, is just 1 min for each character and then you can do other things while is afking that luna.</div>

Script update 19.10.2017 <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile"> 
</div></blockquote>

Results: I did 10 runs and everything was perfect, the last aggro routine is excelent my character managed to keep the aggro every single time. To be honest I wouldnt call this a beta version anymore  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> .<br>
<br>
There's only one thing I can suggest. I believe there's a way to make a verification like: "If monster targeted is dead" (MAAD-S) then do this.<br>
<br>
I would include a "go to the cannons central area coordinate". I recommend this because experience beads and infected lumpus always spawn where cannons are no matter were boss died, and since the MAAD-S aggro routine is traveling through all the map, chances that you will end killing boss far away from the beads is pretty high, so the exp beads wont be destroyed by your Skill 1 and 2. <br>
<br>
Awesome job man, the routines and instance logic were perfectly implemented. I'm really excited about this and your future projects, hopefully I could contribute somehow  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":)" title="Smile">.</div>
