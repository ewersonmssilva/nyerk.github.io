				<div class="content">Thanks for the information. What would the difference be though? I am about to buy sandboxie premium because I have windows 10 and all the cracked versions I got are for older version that do not support windows 10.<br>

Do you know why it is "safer" to use a virtual machine than sandboxie?</div>

You can give each vm a different vpn so no ip connection between the clients.<br>
Also no way to identify hardware.<br>
-&gt; less ban risk if one account gets detected.<br>
But on the other hand you need more resources for vm as its a pc running on your pc</div>

Yes its easyer, less performance depandent and needs less diskspace.<br>
Dont know about the stability, with 3 clients i had increased crashrate wich might be solved by copying aion client to multiple locations.<br>
Also i dont know how far gm´s do watch for multiple connections from one spot.<br>
Thats why i use vpn to protect my main accounts.</div>

I personally use vanilla to multichar now (to afk luna) he has a script and there is a command in vanilla scripting that you can set the framerate on the client whether he is running in front or as a background process. The thing is that when you vanilla your toon even in the background the scripts make your client act as if it is in front so there are no problems in delays etc. So running multiple chars was too much.<br>
<br>
But now I opened 7 clients and 7 vanillas and it took me to 30% CPU usage and like 75% RAM (I am still running on 16GB RAM, I'll update later)<br>
<br>
I have zero crashes when I do that. The only time I crash is when I run one client with AS aethertapping, that is when nothing in the world will save me from crashing. Sometimes it lasts 30 minutes, other times 10 hours.<br>
<br>

I do not think NCSoft cares so much about connections, unless you were referring to Game Forge(which I used to play since I am european, but I left). They even saw my toons afk fallen poeta and all I got is "don't do that again" <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
Man you gotta love NCSoft<br>
<br>
Below is a snapshot I took for paraly in his thread after tweaking my fps for all clients, 7 clients + 7 bots and my CPU was barely moved:<br>
