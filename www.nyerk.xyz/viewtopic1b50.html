Sry i dropped the support for it in current AionScript Version. Finding this offset is not the problem.<br>
Since i took over i changed many things in AionScript and added completly new things.<br>
<br>
Dropped:<br>
NameSearch<br>
Marking Npcs, Players<br>
Attack Range<br>
<br>
Added:<br>
Quest Support<br>
Resurrect Support (Kisk)<br>
New Cooldown System<br>
Console<br>
Field of View<br>
Chargeable Skills, Multicast Skills<br>
...<br>
<br>
Fixed:<br>
Performance Issues<br>
Many Bugs in AionScript<br>
Updated to .NET 4.6<br>
Targeting Bug (Server Based mismatching Info)<br>
Some other things i can't remember  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I currently do not play Aion anymore so do not expect too much love from me anymore.<br>
I will keep AionScript updated but i will not put so much effort in it like before.<br>
It will stay free and ppl like Coco keeps me supporting it.<br>
Most ppl here just use it without giving something back to the community.<br>
Boo could also help, i think he knows *some* things about AS.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":idea:" title="Idea"> <br>
AionScript Source Code is not protected in any way and i will never do that so any1 can look into the source code and do his own things if the person has the knowledge for it.</div>

I'm really sad after reading this. When I found out this program was getting a revamp I thought the community was going to be even bigger than before.<br>
<br>
I agree with the part about people not giving too much to the community, I myself have tons of ideas for scripts because I'm playing the game and I used this tool since it was first released.<br>
<br>
I understand coding isnt for everyone, but if there's not enough basic information or guidance to start with this then nobody will take the time to develop anything. That's why most people is just waiting here for stuff ready to download and use. It would be really awesome if you guys create a "bootcamp" section on the forum, with detailed guides and that stuff and some tuition every now and then from the best scripters of the forum. Dont get me wrong, tutorial section is really useful, but the current level and activity isnt even close to what complex scripts require.<br>
<br>
Again, thank you so much nucular for giving this software a chance, I hope more people get into the project and you could come back to see everything doing better.</div>
